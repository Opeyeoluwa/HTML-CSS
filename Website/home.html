			<h4>History of The Rubix Cube</h4>
			<p>
				Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br>

				I am writing this letter to inform you of my intentions to marry your daughter. She is an epitome of beauty and a spitting image of perfection. I met her two years ago at a dinner party organized by a mutual friend of ours. When she walked into the room, everyone's attenton was immediately drawn to her. I was to shy to approach her that night but when I met her later in a church service, i summoned the courage to walk up to her and introduce myself.

				This letter is written as a recommendation for Rik Josh. Rik Josh is an individual who is dilligent,dutiful and posseses a high sense of responsibilty.He has a good command of English language and has  excellent communication skills. His vast level of experience in writing shows that he would be a great addition to your organisation.  A brief look at his resume shows how efficient he could be with even the smallest resources.He would no doubt be able to discharge his duties to the best of his abilties.His resume is attached to this letter of recommendation.I hope Mr. Josh would be considered for the job.

				There are only a handful of toys that last more than a generation. But the Rubik's cube, which celebrates its 40th birthday (and features on Google with a Doodle), now joins the likes of Barbie, Play-Doh, Lego and the Slinky, as one of the great survivors in the toy cupboard.What makes its success all the remarkable is that it did not start out as a toy. The Rubik's cube was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian architect, who wanted a working model to help explain three-dimensional geometry.

			I am writing this letter to inform you of my intentions to marry your daughter. She is an epitome of beauty and a spitting image of perfection. I met her two years ago at a dinner party organized by a mutual friend of ours. When she walked into the room, everyone's attenton was immediately drawn to her. I was to shy to approach her that night but when I met her later in a church service, i summoned the courage to walk up to her and introduce myself.

			Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
